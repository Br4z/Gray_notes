## General definition

DevOps is a collaborative software development approach that seeks to integrate and coordinate the processes of development and operations with the goal of accelerating the delivery of **high-quality** software and reducing time to market. The term DevOps originated from the combination of the words "development" (Dev) and "operations" (Ops).

> According to Microsoft Azure.

## Collaboration and communication

DevOps emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. This means breaking down silos and promoting a culture of shared responsibility.

> Silo is a repository of data that's controlled by one department or business unit and isolated from the rest of an organization.

## Continuous integration and delivery

DevOps relies on automated processes for building, testing, and deploying software.  Continuous integration (CI) ensures that changes are integrated into the main codebase as quickly and seamlessly as possible. Continuous delivery (CD) ensures that the software is always in a releasable state.

## Continuous deployment

The practice of automatically deploying every change that passes through the delivery pipeline to production without any human intervention. This means that if a change passes all the automated tests and quality gates, it is automatically deployed to production.

## Monitoring and feedback

It enables teams to quickly identify issues and ﬁx them before end users are impacted. Additionally, by collecting real-time data and metrics, teams can continually improve software performance and quality through constant feedback, leading to a faster and more efficient software delivery cycle.
