# Gray notes

Notes on everything I have learned and have not been too lazy to write down. For its correct visualization you must download the [Dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron) extension in your Visual Studio Code.

The motivation for using Dendron over other knowledge management tools is that I don't have to leave my editor behind, having it all in one place is wonderful. If you want to know more about Dendron, visit the [wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so).

> Dendron should recognize the workspace immediately when you open the folder (add it to your current workspace) where you clone this repository.

Feel free to make pull request to fix the bullshit you find in what I have written.
